###Kapi: Notes on the fly

Kapi is a math/science notebook for Windows 8/8.1 made in metro style. It was made during Code.fun.do 2014 at IIT Bombay.

Type beautiful, rendered math on your desktop without remembering any complex commands. Quick, intuitive and elegant.

###To start:

1.	Right click to open the menu.

2.	Select the <b>New</b> or <b>Open</b> icon to open a new note.

3.	Type in normal text for taking your notes.

4.	Whenever you want to enter a mathematical expression, click on the <b>Add Math</b> button or press <b>Alt + M</b>.
Notice that the cursor is now inside a pink box - that tells you itâ€™s going to render the symbols in math notation.

5.	Enter a mathematical expression such as (x^2 + x = 0) and press enter. This is rendered as <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x^{2} + x = 0" border="0"/>

6.	A preview of the typeset math appears on the left. When you're done, press the button once more(or double click outside) and the rendered math will be added inline into your notes.

7.	To save, right click anywhere on the screen and select the <b>Save</b> option. Save the file with the ".kapi" extension.

###Adding math:

1. The app uses MathJax for rendering symbols and its usual syntax works here too.

2. Alphanumeric characters and regular keyboard symbols are rendered in regular script.

3. Powers are shown by the "^" symbol. Functions are rendered as "function_name(parameter value)". For example, sqrt(2^2+1/3) is rendered as <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sqrt{2^{2}+\frac{1}{3} }" border="0"/>

4. Use braces "()" for specifying the scope of various functions and operations. 5+2/x is  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?5+\frac{2}{x}" border="0"/>, while (5+2)/x is  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{5+2}{x}" border="0"/>

###Adding a canvas:

1. Kapi lets you add your own freehand scribbles into your notes with the <b>Canvas</b> option. So you can quickly sketch something to add to your existing notes.

2. To add a canvas, click the <b>Canvas</b> button on the left screen.

3. A new canvas wil pop up on your screen. Select from the <b>Freehand</b>, <b>Line</b>, <b>Rectangle</b>, <b>Circle</b> and <b>Eraser</b> options.

4. Select the appropriate colour and thickness for your drawing.

5. Drag the mouse key around the canvas to make your scribble

6. Once you're done, press the button again (or double click outside) and the image will be added inline into your notes.
